# stupid-shell-tricks
There's a fine line between clever and stupid.

This is a place for things I have personally found useful, but that rely on odd tricks I wouldn't endorse for others to try, for example, things that would only work in an interactive bash session with history enabled, and with perl installed.

Inspiration for the first example came from Simon Tatham's magic aliases:
